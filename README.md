LinuxLife is a collection of useful BASH (Bourne-Again Shell) examples that help new Linux-users 
acclimate to using their command line. They're a collection of things that are either useful 'one-liners'
or commands that can be inserted into, paired with, and/or used in creative ways.
While some are worth committing to muscle memory, others are frankly too esoteric to use all of the time. 

  - Basic commands like `ls -lah`, `cp`, `rm -r` for working with your system's directory structure
  - Working with songs and videos via `youtube-dl`, `play`, `qmmp`, `vlc`, etc.
  - Using basic pipelines to send one command's output to another's input, i.e. 
       ```ps -ef | grep python```

# Linux Made Easy!

  - Unlike manual pages, accessible by `man commandName`, LinuxLife demonstrates how `commandName`
        actually gets used, instead of providing a glossary of options.
